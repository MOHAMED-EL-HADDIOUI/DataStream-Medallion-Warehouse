üì• BRONZE LAYER DATA LOAD SCRIPT
==========================================================

üìå Summary:
This script loads raw data into the Bronze Layer tables of the 
DataStream Medallion Warehouse. It uses source files (e.g., CSVs) or 
external data connections to populate the staging tables created 
in the Bronze schema.

‚úÖ Purpose:
- Ingest data from external sources into the raw layer
- Preserve original structure and values without transformation
- Enable auditability and replayability by storing data as-is

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:
- Assumes that Bronze Layer tables have already been created
- No business logic, cleaning, or enrichment should be applied
- File paths, formats, and delimiters must match the source files

üìÅ Layer: Bronze (Raw / Staging)
